## FILETOOL

Filetool is a filesystem explorer tool. It copies files and
directories, deletes, moves, renames, etc.

This program is created with Qt. In order to compile it and
run it you need Qt. You can find Qt in https://www.qt.io/download

It is developed for practicing and learning Qt and not for real use in a filesystem.
 
I have run many tests and the program seems to be stable and reliable. 

Nevertheless, I would advice caution because it is a program that changes the filesystem,
and in this commit or in some future commit it might have some bug.
There are known bugs because this program is not finished. Even more I am writing this code
to learn writing code with Qt. So it is at best experimental. Thus, you should be careful if you use it.
It is best if you first run it in a Virtual Machine with no important data, until you are
certain that it works ok.


It can be compiled with Qt in Windows or Linux. It works ok in both operating systems
