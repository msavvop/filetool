FILETOOL

Filetool is a filesystem explorer tool. It copies files and 
directories, deletes,moves, renames, etc.

This program is created with Qt. In order to compile it and 
run it you need Qt. You can find Qt in https://www.qt.io/download 

It is developed for practicing and learning Qt and not for real use in a filesystem. 

I have run many tests and the program seems to be stable and reliable. Nevertheless,
I would advice caution because  it is  a program that changes the filesystem,
and in this commit or in some future commit it might have some bug. 
There are known bugs because this program is not finished. Evenmore I am writing this code
to learn writting code with Qt. So it is at best experimental. Thus, you should be careful if you use it. 
It is best if you first run it in a Virtual Machine with no important data, until you are 
certain that it works ok. 

It can be compiled with Qt in Windows or Linux. It works ok in both operating systems.

At this commit I still need to work on recycle, and perfect undo and redo. Undo and redo work ok, 
but the undo rename and undo mkdir and redo rename and redo mkdir have to be implemented. Rename works 
only in table view mode for some reason.

The command delete is permanent and cannot be undone so be careful because what you delete is 
deleted permanently and cannot be undone.

Overwrite control for copy is now implemented and tested. After many tests it seems that it works ok.

To list a few of the problems: Overwrite control for move has not been implemented, and this affetcs 
undo and redo.
Thus, if you move a file over an other file with the same name, you will lose data. It is not 
difficult to implement it and finally I will, but I am doing this in my free time to learn Qt, 
so there is no hurry. 
I corrected the problem of multiple "paste" that would result in data loss 
(if you "paste" something a second time or more times you would lose data, but now this is fixed )
In this commit I implemented the context menu (the menu that appears if you click the right mouse button)
