FILETOOL

Filetool is a filesystem explorer tool. It copies, deletes,moves, etc.
This program is created with Qt. In order to compile it and 
run it you need Qt. You can find Qt in https://www.qt.io/download 

I have run many tests and the program is stable and reliable. Nevertheless,
I would advice caution because  it is  a program that changes the filesystem,
and in some future commit it might have some bug. So, it is best if you first run it
in a Virtual Machine until you are certain that it works ok.

It can be compiled with Qt in Windows or Linux. It works ok in both operating systems.

At this commit I still need to work on recycle, and perfect undo and redo. Undo and redo work ok, 
but the undo rename and undo mkdir and redo rename and redo mkdir have to be implemented.

The command delete is permanent and cannot be undone so be carefull because what you delete is 
deleted permanently and cannot be undone.
