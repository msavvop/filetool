FILETOOL

Filetool is a filesystem explorer tool. It copies files and 
directories, deletes, moves, renames, etc.

This program is created with Qt. In order to compile it and 
run it you need Qt. You can find Qt in https://www.qt.io/download 

It is developed for practicing and learning Qt and not for real use in a filesystem. 

I have run many tests and the program seems to be stable and reliable. Nevertheless,
I would advice caution because  it is  a program that changes the filesystem,
and in this commit or in some future commit it might have some bug. 
There are known bugs because this program is not finished. Evenmore I am writing this code
to learn writting code with Qt. So it is at best experimental. Thus, you should be careful if you use it. 
It is best if you first run it in a Virtual Machine with no important data, until you are 
certain that it works ok. 

It can be compiled with Qt in Windows or Linux. It works ok in both operating systems.

At this commit I still need to work on recycle, and perfect undo and redo. Undo and redo work ok, 
but the undo rename and undo mkdir and redo rename and redo mkdir have to be implemented. Rename works 
only in table view mode for some reason.

The command delete is permanent and cannot be undone so be careful because what you delete is 
deleted permanently and cannot be undone.

Overwrite control for copy and cut (move) is now implemented and tested. 
After many tests it seems that it works ok. Undo and redo work ok  with overwrite 
control but the implementation does not conform with the Microsoft Windows Explorer yet 
and you might lose data if you use undo together with the overwrite. 
I am going to fix that next. It is not difficult to implement it and 
finally I will, but I am doing this in my free time to learn Qt, so there is no hurry.
